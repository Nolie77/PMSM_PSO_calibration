# PMSM_PSO_calibration

The model is constructed based on the PMSM block in Simulink Simscape.
You can directly run the main.m file the parameters.mat will be loaded and the simulation will be executed. 

The input of the model is a arbitarily generated random speed.
Four noise sources are added to the three phase voltages and the measured mechanical position.
